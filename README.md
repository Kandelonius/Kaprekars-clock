# Kaprekars-clock

### Displays the time as well as the number of iterations to get from that time(HH:MM) to Kaprekar's constant.
### Kaprekar's constant is 6174 and is achieved by taking any non-repeating 4-digit number and rearranging it in descending order then ascending order and subtracting the result. Repeat until 6174 is reached.
#### *Note: does not work with 4-digit numbers consisting of 4 consecutive numbers that are the same.
#### Example: 7:45AM would be represented as 0745 and 1:45PM would be 1345
